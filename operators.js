Arithmetic Operators
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus (Remainder of Division)
** Exponential
++ Increment
-- Decrement


Assignment Operators
= Assign 
+= Add and assign
-=  Sub and assign
*=  Multiply and assign
/=  Divide and assign
%=  Modulus and assign
**= Exponential and assign


Comparison Operators
==  equal to
===  equal value and equal type
!=  not equal to
!==  not equal value and type
＞  greater than
＜  less than
＞=  greater than or equal
＜=  less than or equal
?  ternary operator


Logical Operators
&& . - logical AND | True if both conditions are true
||  - logical OR | True if any of the condition is true
! logical NOT| Will return true if the condition is false 
and vice versa


Type Operators
typeof
Returns the type of a variable
We can use the typeof operator to find the data type of a 
JavaScript variable

instanceof
Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
The instanceof operator returns a boolean value that indicates if an 
object is an instance of a particular class


Bitwise Operators
&      AND sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|        OR sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^       XOR sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~       NOT inverts all the bits
＜＜    Left Shift shifts left and fills empty spaces with 0
＞＞    Right Shift shifts right 

Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit numbers 
and work on the level of their binary representation


if statement
if..else statement
if..else..if statement

syntax:
if (expression) {
  Statements to be executed if expression is true

} else{
  Statements to be executed if expression is false
}
